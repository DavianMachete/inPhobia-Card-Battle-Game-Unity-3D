# inPhobia

## How to use the project

  inPhobia is a psychotherapist and tactical card fight simulator with indirect controls. At the moment the project is under development. To open a project, the version of the Unity game engine [2020.3.19f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) is required. Another option is also suitable, but there is a high probability that something will break in the project. Then I advise you to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for more convenient project version control.
  
**Notes**

• This is not a game, but an inPhobia game project developed in Unity.

• Over time, this file will evolve depending on the stage of development.
